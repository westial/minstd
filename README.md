minstd
======

Ultra light-weight C++ standard library used in my personal embedded projects.

All facilities and features are developed according the emerging requirements
and I decided to abstract the common ones here together to make reusability 
easier.

The function names and algorithms do not match with the original standard 
library at all. I called "minstd" because is a kind of standard or common 
utilities, and not because of the original standard libraries.
